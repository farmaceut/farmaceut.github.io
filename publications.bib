	abstract = {The antioxidative and antiradical properties of malvidin (Mv), malvidin 3-O-glucoside (Mv 3-glc) and malvidin 3,5-O-diglucoside (Mv 3,5-diglc) were evaluated by AAPH● and DPPH● assays, respectively. In both cases, a decrease in activity was observed in the following order Mv {\textgreater} Mv 3-glc {\textgreater} Mv 3,5-diglc. Quantum mechanics studies have confirmed this pattern, which can be explained by an underlying activity based on hydrogen atom transfer from C3-hydroxyl. Further measurements of the ability of malvidins to interact with membrane-mimicking liposomes revealed that malvidins, depending on their structure, increase packing order mainly in the hydrophilic region of the membrane bilayer. A mixed molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics protocol explained this in terms of fluctuating charge distribution among the species investigated. These findings are key in explaining elucidating the antioxidant activity of malvidins against membranes as a result of surface rearrangement and may have important implications for future pharmacological applications.},

	abstract = {The importance of post-CCSD(T) corrections as high as CCSDTQ56 for ground-state spectroscopic constants ((Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.)) has been surveyed for a sample of two dozen mostly heavy-atom diatomics spanning a broad range of static correlation strength. While CCSD(T) is known to be an unusually felicitous ‘Pauling point' between accuracy and computational cost, performance leaves something to be desired for molecules with strong static correlation. We find CCSDT(Q) (Formula presented.) to be the next ‘sweet spot' up, of comparable or superior quality to the much more expensive CCSDTQ. A similar comparison applies to CCSDTQ(5) (Formula presented.) vs. CCSDTQ5, while CCSDTQ5(6) (Formula presented.) is essentially indistinguishable from CCSDTQ56. A composite of CCSD(T)-X2C/ACV5Z-X2C with [CCSDT(Q) (Formula presented.)–CCSD(T)]/cc-pVTZ or even cc-pVDZ basis sets appears highly effective for computational vibrational spectroscopy. Unlike CCSDT(Q) which breaks down for the ozone vibrational frequencies, CCSDT(Q) (Formula presented.) handles them gracefully.},

However, their solubility is poor, intensifying experimental research into improving this property. One recently proposed solution is to attach a polyamine macrocycle ring. In this paper, the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) studies on such derivative were performed to assess the impact of the protonationcapable macrocycle and its ability to chelate transition state metals, as illustrated by the Cu(II) ion, on the expected photophysical activity. These properties were determined by examining ultraviolet−visible (UV−vis) spectra, intersystem conversion, and type I and II photoreactions of all species possibly present in a tumor cell. For comparison purposes the structure devoid of the macrocycle was also examined. The results show that the subsequent protonation of amine groups improves the reactivity, with [H2L]4+/[H3L]5+ being borderline, whereas complexation appears to weaken the desired photoactivity.},

The importance of resonance and inductive effects, and also hydrogen bonding, has been underlined, but most importantly, it has been demonstrated that all structures have considerable scavenging potential against all studied radicals, with reactions rates close to the diffusion limit.},

	abstract = {Malvidin, one of the six most prominent anthocyanins found in various fruits and vegetables, may possess a wide range of health-promoting properties. The biological activity of malvidin and its glycosides is not entirely clear and has been relatively less frequently studied compared to other anthocyanins. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relationship between the structural derivatives of malvidin and their anti-cholinergic and anti-inflammatory activity. The study selected malvidin (Mv) and its two sugar derivatives: malvidin 3-O-glucoside (Mv 3-glc) and malvidin 3,5-O-diglucoside (Mv 3,5-diglc). The anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by inhibiting the enzymes, specifically COX-1 and COX-2. Additionally, the inhibitory effects on cholinesterase activity, particularly acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), were evaluated. Molecular modeling was also employed to examine and visualize the interactions between enzymes and anthocyanins. The results revealed that the highest inhibitory capacity at concentration 100 µM was demonstrated by Mv 3-glc in relation to AChE (26.3 ± 3.1\%) and BChE (22.1 ± 3.0\%), highlighting the crucial role of the glycoside substituent at the C3 position of the C ring in determining the inhibitory efficiency of these enzymes. In addition, the glycosylation of malvidin significantly reduced the anti-inflammatory activity of these derivatives compared to the aglycone form. The IC50 parameter demonstrates the following relationship for the COX-1 enzyme: Mv (12.45 ± 0.70 µM) {\textless} Mv 3-glc (74.78 ± 0.06 µM) {\textless} Mv 3,5-diglc (90.36 ± 1.92 µM). Similarly, for the COX-2 enzyme, we have: Mv (2.76 ± 0.16 µM) {\textless} Mv 3-glc (39.92 ± 3.02 µM) {\textless} Mv 3.5-diglc (66.45 ± 1.93 µM). All tested forms of malvidin exhibited higher activity towards COX-2 compared to COX-1, indicating their selectivity as inhibitors of COX-2. Theoretical calculations were capable of qualitatively replicating most of the noted patterns in the experimental data, explaining the impact of deprotonation and glycosylation on inhibitory activity. It can be suggested that anthocyanins, such as malvidins, could be valuable in the development of treatments for inflammatory conditions and Alzheimer’s disease and deserve further study.},

          , 
            
              Alkylresorcinols are a group of natural phenolic compounds found in various foods such as whole grain cereals, bread, and certain fruits. They are known for their beneficial health effects, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of two typical alkylresorcinols namely olivetol and olivetolic acid (Oli and OliA) under physiological conditions. The free radical scavenging capacity of Oli and OliA toward oxygenated free radicals (HO˙ and HOO˙ radicals) was investigated using thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. The results revealed that Oli and OliA are potent scavengers of HO˙ radical in both polar and lipid media, acting exclusively
              via
              the FHT (formal hydrogen transfer) mechanism. Moreover, they demonstrated excellent scavenging activity toward HOO˙ radical in water
              via
              the SET (single electron transfer) mechanism, outperforming the common antioxidant BHT. In lipid media, Oli and OliA showed moderate scavenging activity toward HOO˙ radical
              via
              the FHT mechanism. Significant prooxidant potential of OliA
              −
              was also demonstrated through the formation of complexes with copper ions. Additionally, docking studies indicate that the compounds exhibited a good affinity for ROS-producing enzymes, including myeloperoxidase (MP), cytochrome P450 (CP450), lipoxygenase (LOX), and xanthine oxidase (XO), highlighting their potential as natural antioxidants with promising therapeutic applications.},

              The aim of this review is to summarize the most relevant scientific discoveries regarding SARS- CoV-2 virus infection, with the special emphasis put on its pathophysiology and way of treatment.
            
            
              Methods:
              In November 2020, the research articles have been collected and examined manually to pick the most relevant. In case of fresh topics, e.g. vaccines, we have performed searching using adequate keywords. Preliminary analysis was conducted on 200 manuscripts.
            
            
              Results:
              Among them 59 papers were out-of-scope, and thus were rejected from the further elaboration. Another 25 papers were rebuffed because they presented topics, that have been extensively described in the already included papers. Basing on the 29 papers we have estimated ratio of observed SARS-CoV-2 infection clinical manifestations and comorbidities among hospitalized patients. 12 papers let us evaluate frequencies of deviations within laboratory markers concentrations, as well as weighted average of the laboratory tests results.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Due to the significant infectivity of the virus and its harmfulness towards organism further studies are required to find accurate way of the disease treatment and suspending its spreading.},

Their properties prevent the accumulation of radicals in the body and the development of oxidative stress, a recognized trigger for some diseases and a manifestation of others. Nonetheless, apart from their beneficial effects, polyphenols might also exhibit proox­ idant potential, often observed as the oxidation of transition state metals, resulting in amplified radical pro­ duction. DFT studies at the B3LYP/6–311++G(d,p) level of theory were conducted on nine common polyphenolic compounds to assess both activities in physiologically relevant media. It has been found that there is a fine line between antioxidant and prooxidant character, and increasing pH values promote the occurrence of the latter. Anthocyanidins proved to be the most potent radical scavengers, particularly under slightly alkaline conditions, followed by flavonoids and phenolic acids last. Antiradical activity is better in a polar solvent than in apolar one, due to the possibility of dissociation.},

Calculations of determinants were performed: speciﬁc, for the three possible mechanisms of action—hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), electron transfer–proton transfer (ETPT) and sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET); and the unspeciﬁc—reorganization enthalpy (RE) and hydrogen abstraction enthalpy (HAE). Intramolecular hydrogen bonding, catechol moiety activity and the probability of electron density swap between rings were all established. Hydrogen bonding seems to be much more important than the conjugation eﬀect, because some structures tends to form more intramolecular hydrogen bonds instead of being completely planar. The very ﬁrst hydrogen abstraction mechanism in a water solvent is SPLET, and the most privileged abstraction site, indicated by HAE, can be associated with the C3 hydroxyl group of ﬂavonols and C4’ hydroxyl group of ﬂavones. For the catechol moiety, an intramolecular reorganization to an o-benzoquinone-like structure occurs, and the ETPT is favored as the second abstraction mechanism.},

	abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is one of the most frequent human pathogens and a leading etiological agent of various gastric diseases. As stringent response, coordinated by a SpoT protein, seems to be crucial for the survivability of H. pylori, the main goal of this article was to use in silico computational studies to ﬁnd phytochemical compounds capable of binding to the active site of SpoT from H. pylori and conﬁrm the ability of the most active candidates to interfere with the virulence of this bacterium through in vitro experiments. From 791 natural substances submitted for the virtual screening procedure, 10 were chosen and followed for further in vitro examinations. Among these, dioscin showed the most interesting parameters (the lowest MIC, the highest anti-bioﬁlm activity in static conditions, and a relatively low stimulation of morphological transition into coccoids). Therefore, in the last part, we extended the research with a number of further experiments and observed the ability of dioscin to signiﬁcantly reduce the formation of H. pylori bioﬁlm under Bioﬂuxgenerated ﬂow conditions and its capacity for additive enhancement of the antibacterial activity of all three commonly used antibiotics (clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levoﬂoxacin). Based on these results, we suggest that dioscin may be an interesting candidate for new therapies targeting H. pylori survivability and virulence.},

Betalains’ dissociation process and electronic structure were examined, as well as the reactivity in six pathways against some common radicals, such as hydroxyl, hydroperoxide, superoxide, and nitric oxide. The study showed that all carboxyl groups are dissociated in the given conditions. The dissociation process impacts the electronic structure, which has consequences for the overall activity. Highly stabilized conjugated structures favor the electron–accepting type of scavenging reactions, primarily by a radical adduct formation mechanism. Betanidin and indicaxanthin were found to be the most promising of the compounds studied. Nevertheless, the study established the role of betalains as powerful antiradical dietary agents.},

A comprehensive structure–activity investigation with density functional theory methods elucidated the inﬂuence of compounds topology, resonance stabilization, and intramolecular hydrogen bonding on the exhibited activity. The key factor was found to be a presence of two or more hydroxyl groups being located in ortho or para position to each other. Finally, the quantitative structure–activity relationship approach was used to build a multiple linear regression model describing the dependence of antioxidant activity on structure of compounds, using features exclusively related to their topology.

To ease this process, it is critical to identify the optimal level of theory in terms of both accuracy and resource usage—a challenge we tackle in this study. Eleven DFT functionals with varied Hartree–Fock exchange values, both global and range-separated hybrids, were combined with 14 differently augmented basis sets to calculate the reactivity indices of caffeic acid, a phenolic acid representative, and compare them to experimental data or a high-level of theory outcome. Aside from the main course, a validation of the widely used Janak’s theorem in the establishment of vertical ionization potential and vertical electron afﬁnity was evaluated. To investigate what inﬂuences the values of the properties under consideration, linear regression models were developed and thoroughly discussed. The results were utilized to compute the scores, which let us determine the best and worst combinations and make broad suggestions on the ﬁnal option.

The ability of anthocyanins to scavenge free radicals was determined using DPPH• assay, whereas the inhibition of peroxidation in liposomes in relation to a model membrane that imitated the composition of a lipid membrane in tumor cells was specified using the fluorimetric method. To explore this issue at the atomistic level, density functional theory studies were applied. It was shown that glycosides performed better than anthocyanidins in protecting membranes against oxidation. The highest redox potential was demonstrated by anthocyanidins with the highest number of hydroxyl groups in the B ring in the order as follows: (Dp {\textgreater} Pt {\textgreater} Pn), and the same relationship was proven for their glucosides. The majority of the compounds studied here proved to be better antioxidants than ascorbic acid. They showed consistent electrodonating properties and though the f-HAT mechanism became more feasible with each consecutive deprotonation. Glycosylation did not have a direct impact on reactivity, apart from peonidin and petunidin in the study of which it was found that this process was responsible for lifting off steric hindrance between B and C rings and rendering certain pathways more feasible.

We show RROA for a number of model vitamin B12 derivatives that are chemically similar but exhibit distinctively different spectroscopic behavior. The ECD/ROA effect is proportional to the concentration and dependent on the optical pathlength of the light propagating through the sample. It can severely alter relative band intensities and signs in the natural RROA spectra. The spectra analyses are supported by computational modeling based on density functional theory.
